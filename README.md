## Introduction

This is a 2D game based on OpenGL and C++.
According to [learingOpenGL](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/06%20In%20Practice/2D-Game/01%20Breakout/), some new features are added, including new buff, multiple players, score system, console memu and and customed level.
And it also uses new archetecture to fullfill the game.

__Caveat__
I am not a professional game developer, nor a professional C++ programmer. This is just a program for practice. So the design may be unconventional or sub-optimal in many ways. Happy to take feedback from any pros out there!
