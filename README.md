## Introduction

This is a 2D game based on OpenGL and C++. And some content is referred to [space-shooter.c](https://github.com/tsherif/space-shooter.c)
According to [learingOpenGL](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/06%20In%20Practice/2D-Game/01%20Breakout/), some new features are added, including new buff, flexible size of the window and customed level.
And it also uses new archetecture to fullfill the game with nice comments in the code, which makes it friendly to beginners.

__Caveat__
I am not a professional game developer, nor a professional C++ programmer. This is just a program for practice. So the design may be unconventional or sub-optimal in many ways. Happy to take feedback from any pros out there!
